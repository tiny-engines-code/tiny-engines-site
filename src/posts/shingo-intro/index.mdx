---

I've always leaned towards the Shingo principles of organizational excellence as a way of defining how people can best work in an organization.  For me they encompass a frame of mind rather than just a set of behaviors.

The Shingo Institute (https://shingo.org/), is the organization that awards the Shingo Prize, has identified ten "Guiding Principles in the Shingo Model" as forming the basis for building a sustainable culture of organizational excellence.


No philosophy really survives it's own formalization and one has to sift through what makes sense in a given moment, but these principles are general and 'humanistic' and that's appropriate, because the organization is made up of ... well... humans, with our basic needs, shifting energies, world views, and all of our inconsistencies.
The Shingo principles work by focusing on core principles instead of prescriptions.

Some of the principles have a manufacturing overtone, but for me, even those that don't immediately resonate still have application in the world of technology.

These are some ways that each Shingo principle resonates for those of us who practice technology.

<h3 style={{opacity: '.5', backgroundColor: '#640b8a', height: '40px' , padding:  '9px 10px', color: 'white'}}>Respect every individual</h3>

Software engineering, like many other disciplines is already a crossroads of different cultures, and world-views -- and is at the same time sometimes struggling to be more inclusive to obvious differences like gender and race.  One does not have to be in the industry long to witness the discordance between different world-views, the misplaced assumptions about who "we" are or what "we" believe in.  From those experiences I believe that no set of words or behaviors can make an organization more inclusive to 'outsiders', but that cultivating genuine respect for other world-views can.

In the Zulu language the greeting "sawubona" means "i see you" but is intended as more than just a polite greeting –  I see the whole of you, your humanity,  abilities,  and differences – you are important.  I'll assert without any scientific proof that  that the ability to 'see' others is the key to genuine respect, and that genuine respect is more a frame of mind than a set of behaviors. People know or sense when we are sincerely respectful or are just following a set of prescribed behaviors.

Some of the behaviors that might flow from that mindset might be:

* Listening to and incorporating other viewpoints
* Choose contribution over exceptionalism
* Understanding that the 'team' is not something that people 'fit into' it's a group of individuals with different experiences, skills, energies
* Respect for work-life balance
* Spend the time to contribute to career goals


<h3 style={{opacity: '.5', backgroundColor: '#640b8a', height: '40px' , padding:  '9px 10px', color: 'white'}}>Lead with humility</h3>

I believe that humility in this sense is the willingness to consider and promote the ideas and talents of others.  That can't be achieved if we reward individual success over collective contribution to the organization.  One can't be humble if one has to use a megaphone to get attention. Antiquated practices such as stack-ranking have long been debunked, but reward systems sometimes carry over and focus more on individual contribution.  Without passing judgement on that approach, a company might move in the direction of this principle simply by rewarding it. A few principles could be:

* be consistent in our process with every individual.
* create an environment where we share 'credit' and celebrate the success of others.
* align our measurement of success with organizational goals
* measure the contribution of others based on relentlessly objective criteria -- avoid judgements like 'enthusiasm'


<h3 style={{opacity: '.5', backgroundColor: '#640b8a', height: '40px' , padding:  '9px 10px', color: 'white'}}>Seek perfection</h3>

Shingo defines the goal of seeking perfection as creating long-term solutions rather than leave temporary fixes and consistently working to streamline and simplify.

Both the understanding and the desire for that 'perfection' already exists in most teams.   It does not require consultants, or a new theory or other revelation.  We can and should start with the premise that our teams do understand the value of long-term solutions and simplifying work, and that we just need to create the environment that supports it.

But complete perfection is actually not attainable, so the key in seeking it is to allow the 'seeking' to improve rather than incapacitate.  It's counter-productive for us or anyone to make pronouncements about the way things "should be" done.  That takes no real insight and impedes the harder work needed to decide what can be done.  Seek perfection in small practical bites.




<h3 style={{opacity: '.5', backgroundColor: '#640b8a', height: '40px' , padding:  '9px 10px', color: 'white'}}>Assure quality at the source</h3>

Shingo defines quality at the source as organizing our environment so potential problems become immediately visible, and errors can be fixed as they come up.

Like the "seek perfection" principle, it's easy to state this as a broad principle, but achieving the right balance is where we find grace.   If we don't set the standard, or if we don't invest our capacity there and just leave it to each individual to determine the balance - then we are not assuring quality at the source - we are just hoping it happens.



<h3 style={{opacity: '.5', backgroundColor: '#640b8a', height: '40px' , padding:  '9px 10px', color: 'white'}}>Flow and pull value</h3>

Don't build more than you need.  That principle may come from the manufacturing world, but it is equally applicable to software design where there's always been a push/pull on between just building what's absolutely required, and what we think might be required in the future.

There's no right answer but I think in terms of emphasising more **clarity** over more **functionality**.   We may or may not be able to predict what will be needed in the future, but we can focus on making the code easier to navigate so that future changes are more efficient.  Where this can be effected is in standards, and during code reviews, retros, etc.

And we can help by avoiding the following scenes:

* There is no reward for spending time on standards
* Developers are too burned out or focused on their own deliverable to provide a good code review
* Developers are caught in a spiral of mild disagreement with no objective option for disengaging
* R&D projects don't have an efficient way to 'drop' a lot of code at once




<h3 style={{opacity: '.5', backgroundColor: '#640b8a', height: '40px' , padding:  '9px 10px', color: 'white'}}>Embrace scientific thinking</h3>

The concept of scientific thinking is so well-known that its amazing how often it's overlooked.  We might hear a statement floating around that "solution A is bad because it  loads too slowly".  That's an isolated statement that does not take the full picture into account.  It's a sound-bite masquerading as an answer, but it can gain traction and prevent the scientific approach.

We all know the questions that need to be asked, so the key is to make the asking an normal part of the decision-making conversation:

Ok, it does load slowly, but:
* [x] Does it load too slowly for our needs?
* [x] As a matter of fact – what are our needs? business priorities, future plans, time to market,
* [x] what are its other features and drawbacks?
* [x] And how do they compare as a whole to solution B?
* [x] What about intangibles like learning curves, expense, maturity, etc.
* [x] how much time and effort should we invest to get all the facts, and what managed risks should we take to get to a (quicker) decision?


<h3 style={{opacity: '.5', backgroundColor: '#640b8a', height: '40px' , padding:  '9px 10px', color: 'white'}}>Focus on process</h3>

As a developer I used to think of 'process' in terms of unproductive meetings, and self-fulfilling rituals.  That kind of process is clearly unhelpful and we spend a lot of time trying to get away from it.   But 'process' if done well can and should protect us from embarrassing errors, improve communication, and improve quality and automation. The kind of processes that are in service to those sorts of measurable goals are no so much overhead as enabling practices, and that alone makes it worth spending time to choose them carefully.


<h3 style={{opacity: '.5', backgroundColor: '#640b8a', height: '40px' , padding:  '9px 10px', color: 'white'}}>Think systemically</h3>

One thing I see in myself and in other engineers is tunnel vision.  It's not because we don't have the capability to see the big picture.  It's more often because we are focused on solving a complex problem and that takes a lot of focus.  So a developer might be asked:  when will "it" be done - and they might answer that it will be done in a week -- But they are talking about the current technical challenge - and the product manager may be thinking about the release date.  Each individual in this small two-person 'system' is understandably focused on their specific view of the problem, but we are a better team if we all take the time to understand how we all fit into the bigger 'system' and find ways to make problem solving and communication efficient.

On the engineering side, having been in the trenches I'll always suggest to engineers that they don't rush into a scheduled meeting directly from a session of coding or problem solving.  Take a deep breath, organize your thoughts, and jot down a few talking points that might come up.  Be ready to communicate status and scope and to be clear about what's being asked and what your answer should be.  These 'soft' skills may not produce code - but they make the 'system' of creating solutions more efficient.


<h3 style={{opacity: '.5', backgroundColor: '#640b8a', height: '40px' , padding:  '9px 10px', color: 'white'}}>Create constancy of purpose</h3>

Shingo defines "constancy of purpose" as clearly communicating the direction and purpose of the organization to all, and setting goals that are connected to the organization’s overall goals.  That's clearly the goal of this principle, but the nuance for software engineering management is the "constancy" part -- there are many forces in a software project, and it's easy to get into and endless cycle of firefights, or spend a lot of effort that seemed clearly important at the time but at the end of the year have not really produced the 'big' results that the organization needs.

In this changing world the ability to 'pivot' quickly is an asset, but the art is having enough consistency of purpose to build one big thing - even if it's not perfect -- rather than spending an entire year on little pivots that don't produce a discernible benefit to the organization.

If during an end-of-year goal setting we find ourselves saying that we did a ton of work but nothing anyone is exited about now, a year later - then I think we need to seriously consider whether we have achieved the constancy of purpose the organization needs.


<h3 style={{opacity: '.5', backgroundColor: '#640b8a', height: '40px' , padding:  '9px 10px', color: 'white'}}>Create value for the customer</h3>

We all know what t feels like to deal with a great company with great customer service.   But for many organizations it's easy to get buried in the day-to-day grind, the lack of resources, the soccer game we have to get to by 7pm tonight.  It's easily become an organization full of well-meaning people that cannot seem to translate those good intentions into a consistent and cogent customer-facing presence.

I'm not sure whether there's one set of guidelines and practices that ensure great customer focus in any organization, but certainly at least part of the equation is just imbuing everyone consistently with the capacity, rewards, and the sense of ownership that adds up to great customer value.
