  Work in progress - Shingo
</h3>

---

I've always leaned towards the Shingo principles of organizational excellence as a way of articulating a personal "true north". For me they encompass a frame of mind rather than just a set of behaviors.

No philosophy survives it's own formalization, even for Shingo. The Shingo principles work by focusing on core principles instead of prescriptions and that gives them relevance in a wide variety of situations includng software engineering.

The Shingo Institute (https://shingo.org/), is the organization that awards the Shingo Prize, has identified ten "Guiding Principles in the Shingo Model" as forming the basis for building a sustainable culture of organizational excellence. This page relies on that work, but focuses on their application to those of us who practice technology.

In this page I'll walk through the principles and how I personally interpret them through the lens of software engineering.

  Respect every individual
</h3>

Software engineering, is a crossroads of different cultures and world-views --we struggle to be more inclusive to culture, gender and race. One does not have to be in the industry long to witness the discordance between different world-views, the misplaced assumptions about who "we" are or what "we" believe in. I believe that no set of words or behaviors make an organization more inclusive, but cultivating genuine respect for other world-views can.

In the Zulu language the greeting "sawubona" means "i see you" but is intended as more than just a polite greeting – I see the whole of you, your humanity, abilities, and differences – you are important. I'll assert without any scientific proof that taking the time to 'see' others is the key to genuine respect, and that genuine respect is more a frame of mind than a set of behaviors. Most people know or sense when we are sincerely respectful or are just following a set of prescribed behaviors, and they'll react accordingly.

<p>For me, some practical reminders are:</p>

- [x] Really listen to other approaches to challenges
- [x] Choose contribution over exceptionalism
- [x] Remember that the 'team' is not something that people 'fit into' it's a group of individuals with different experiences, skills, and energies
- [x] Have respect for work-life balance
- [x] Spend the time to contribute career goals

  Lead with humility
</h3>

Humility to me is the willingness to consider and promote the ideas and talents of others. Why is humility important?  Speaking from personal experience I've been a member of teams that operated through fear -- this was not something intentional, but at the end of the day, the motivation of the members of the team were largely driven by fear or failure, embarrassment, loss of gainful employment.  These can be effective motivators.   But over time, a certain fatigue sets in, where it's just not "fun" anymore, and the people eventually start looking for escape.  And in many ways the the quality of problem-solving and innovation is limited because people are more focused on 'survival'.

For me, the concepts of exceptionalism, heroics, the need to "win" over others in order to get ahead -- these can be motivators in the case that there are enough exceptional people who have a long term comittment to our goals.
We might move in the direction of this principle simply by nurturing and rewarding it.

- [x] be consistent in our process with every individual.
- [x] create an environment where we share 'credit' and celebrate the success of others.
- [x] align our measurement of success with organizational goals
- [x] measure the contribution of others based on relentlessly objective criteria

  Seek perfection
</h3>

Shingo defines the goal of seeking perfection as creating long-term solutions rather than leaving temporary fixes, and consistently working to streamline and simplify.
Complete perfection is actually not attainable so perhaps seeking perfection is really finding the right balance between practical nessessity and rigor - and to improve rather than incapacitate.

  Assure quality at the source
</h3>

Shingo defines quality at the source as organizing our environment so potential problems become immediately visible, and errors can be fixed as they come up.

Like the "seek perfection" principle, it's easy to state this as a broad principle, but achieving the right balance is where we find grace. If we don't set the standard, or if we don't invest our capacity there and just leave it to each individual to determine the balance - then we are not assuring quality at the source - we are just hoping it happens.

  Flow and pull value
</h3>

Don't build more than you need. That principle may come from the manufacturing world, but it is equally applicable to software design where there's always been a push/pull on between just building what's absolutely required, and what we think might be required in the future.

There's no right answer but I think in terms of emphasising more **clarity** over more **functionality**. We may or may not be able to predict what will be needed in the future, but we can focus on making our code easier to navigate so that future changes are more efficient. Where this can be effected is in standards, and during code reviews, retros, etc.

  Embrace scientific thinking
</h3>

The concept of scientific thinking is so well-known that its amazing how often it's overlooked. We might hear a statement floating around that "solution A is bad because it loads too slowly". That's an isolated statement that does not take the full picture into account. It's a sound-bite masquerading as an answer, but it can gain traction and prevent the scientific approach.

We all know the questions that need to be asked, so the key is to make the asking an normal part of the decision-making conversation:

Ok, it does load slowly, but:

- [x] Does it load too slowly for our needs?
- [x] What exactly are our needs?
- [x] What are its other features and drawbacks?
- [x] And how do they compare as a whole to solution B?
- [x] What about intangibles like learning curves, expense, maturity, etc.
- [x] how much time and effort should we invest to get all the facts, and what managed risks should we take to get to a (quicker) decision?

  Focus on process
</h3>

As a developer I used to think of 'process' in terms of unproductive meetings, and self-fulfilling rituals. That kind of process is clearly unhelpful and we all spend a lot of time trying to get away from it. But 'process' if done well can and should protect us from embarrassing errors, improve communication, and improve quality and automation. Processes that is in service to those measurable goals can become enabling practice rather than overhead.

  Think systemically
</h3>

Its easy to get locked into a tunnel vision, especially when solving a complex problem. It's important for everyone to be able to 'come up for air' and consider the whole system of different skills and motivations that make up a given project.

  Create constancy of purpose
</h3>

Shingo defines "constancy of purpose" as clearly communicating the direction and purpose of the organization to all, and setting goals that are connected to the organization’s overall goals. That's clearly the goal of this principle, but the nuance for software engineering management is the "constancy" part -- there are many forces in a software project, and it's easy to get into and endless cycle of firefights, or spend a lot of effort that seemed clearly important at the time but at the end of the year have not really produced the 'big' results that the organization needs.

In this changing world the ability to 'pivot' quickly is an asset, but if at the end of the year we find ourselves realizing that we did a ton of work but nothing that anyone is still exited about now - then perhaps we should consider whether we have achieved the constancy of purpose the organization needs.

  Create value for the customer
</h3>

We all know what t feels like to deal with a great company with great customer service. But it's easy to get buried in the day-to-day grind, the lack of resources, the balance of life and work.
I'm not sure whether there's one formula that ensures great customer focus, but at least part of the equation is to provide everyone consistently with the capacity, rewards, and sense of ownership that adds up to greater customer value.
