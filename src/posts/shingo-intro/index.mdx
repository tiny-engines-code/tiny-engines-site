---

I've always leaned towards the Shingo principles of organizational excellence as a way of defining how people best work in an organization.  For me they encompass a frame of mind rather than just a set of behaviors.

No philosophy survives it's own formalization, and we have to decide what still makes practical sense in a given time.  The Shingo principles however work by focusing on core principles instead of specific prescriptions and that gives them relevance in a wide variety of situations without getting locked into any specific dogma.

The Shingo Institute (https://shingo.org/), is the organization that awards the Shingo Prize, has identified ten "Guiding Principles in the Shingo Model" as forming the basis for building a sustainable culture of organizational excellence.  This page relies on that work, but focuses on their application to those of us who practice technology.


<h3 style={{opacity: '.5', backgroundColor: '#640b8a', height: '35px' , padding:  '6px 10px', color: 'white'}}>Respect every individual</h3>

Software engineering, is a crossroads of different cultures and world-views -- and is at the same time struggling to be more inclusive to culture, gender and race.  One does not have to be in the industry long to witness the discordance between different world-views, the misplaced assumptions about who "we" are or what "we" believe in.  From those experiences I believe that no set of words or behaviors make an organization more inclusive, but that cultivating genuine respect for other world-views can.

In the Zulu language the greeting "sawubona" means "i see you" but is intended as more than just a polite greeting –  I see the whole of you, your humanity,  abilities,  and differences – you are important.  I'll assert without any scientific proof that  that the ability to 'see' others is the key to genuine respect, and that genuine respect is more a frame of mind than a set of behaviors. Most people know or sense when we are sincerely respectful or are just following a set of prescribed behaviors, and they'll react accordingly.

<p>Some of the behaviors that might flow from that mindset might be:</p>

* Listening to and incorporating other viewpoints
* Choose contribution over exceptionalism
* Understanding that the 'team' is not something that people 'fit into' it's a group of individuals with different experiences, skills, energies
* Respect for work-life balance
* Spend the time to contribute to career goals


<h3 style={{opacity: '.5', backgroundColor: '#640b8a', height: '35px' , padding:  '6px 10px', color: 'white'}}>Lead with humility</h3>

I believe that humility in this sense is the willingness to consider and promote the ideas and talents of others.  A company might move in the direction of this principle simply by rewarding it. A few key behaviors might be:

* be consistent in our process with every individual.
* create an environment where we share 'credit' and celebrate the success of others.
* align our measurement of success with organizational goals
* measure the contribution of others based on relentlessly objective criteria -- avoid judgements like 'enthusiasm'


<h3 style={{opacity: '.5', backgroundColor: '#640b8a', height: '35px' , padding:  '6px 10px', color: 'white'}}>Seek perfection</h3>

Shingo defines the goal of seeking perfection as creating long-term solutions rather than leave temporary fixes and consistently working to streamline and simplify.  Both the understanding and the desire for that goal already exist in most teams.  We can start with the premise that our teams do understand the value of long-term solutions and simplifying and that we just need to create the environment that supports it.

However, complete perfection is actually not attainable so the key in seeking it is to allow the 'seeking' to improve rather than incapacitate.  It's counter-productive to make pronouncements about the way things "should be" done.  That takes no real insight and impedes the harder work needed to decide what can be done.


<h3 style={{opacity: '.5', backgroundColor: '#640b8a', height: '35px' , padding:  '6px 10px', color: 'white'}}>Assure quality at the source</h3>

Shingo defines quality at the source as organizing our environment so potential problems become immediately visible, and errors can be fixed as they come up.

Like the "seek perfection" principle, it's easy to state this as a broad principle, but achieving the right balance is where we find grace.   If we don't set the standard, or if we don't invest our capacity there and just leave it to each individual to determine the balance - then we are not assuring quality at the source - we are just hoping it happens.



<h3 style={{opacity: '.5', backgroundColor: '#640b8a', height: '35px' , padding:  '6px 10px', color: 'white'}}>Flow and pull value</h3>

Don't build more than you need.  That principle may come from the manufacturing world, but it is equally applicable to software design where there's always been a push/pull on between just building what's absolutely required, and what we think might be required in the future.

There's no right answer but I think in terms of emphasising more **clarity** over more **functionality**.   We may or may not be able to predict what will be needed in the future, but we can focus on making the code easier to navigate so that future changes are more efficient.  Where this can be effected is in standards, and during code reviews, retros, etc.

And we can help by avoiding the following scenes:

* There is no reward for spending time on standards
* Developers are too burned out or focused on their own deliverable to provide a good code review
* Developers are caught in a spiral of mild disagreement with no objective option for disengaging
* R&D projects don't have an efficient way to 'drop' a lot of code at once




<h3 style={{opacity: '.5', backgroundColor: '#640b8a', height: '35px' , padding:  '6px 10px', color: 'white'}}>Embrace scientific thinking</h3>

The concept of scientific thinking is so well-known that its amazing how often it's overlooked.  We might hear a statement floating around that "solution A is bad because it  loads too slowly".  That's an isolated statement that does not take the full picture into account.  It's a sound-bite masquerading as an answer, but it can gain traction and prevent the scientific approach.

We all know the questions that need to be asked, so the key is to make the asking an normal part of the decision-making conversation:

Ok, it does load slowly, but:
* [x] Does it load too slowly for our needs?
* [x] As a matter of fact – what are our needs? business priorities, future plans, time to market,
* [x] what are its other features and drawbacks?
* [x] And how do they compare as a whole to solution B?
* [x] What about intangibles like learning curves, expense, maturity, etc.
* [x] how much time and effort should we invest to get all the facts, and what managed risks should we take to get to a (quicker) decision?


<h3 style={{opacity: '.5', backgroundColor: '#640b8a', height: '35px' , padding:  '6px 10px', color: 'white'}}>Focus on process</h3>

As a developer I used to think of 'process' in terms of unproductive meetings, and self-fulfilling rituals.  That kind of process is clearly unhelpful and we all spend a lot of time trying to get away from it.   But 'process' if done well can and should protect us from embarrassing errors, improve communication, and improve quality and automation. Processes that is in service to those measurable goals can become enabling practice rather than overhead.  That alone makes it worth spending time to choose them carefully and support them.


<h3 style={{opacity: '.5', backgroundColor: '#640b8a', height: '35px' , padding:  '6px 10px', color: 'white'}}>Think systemically</h3>

Its easy to get locked into our own tunnel vision, especially when solving a complex problem.  It's important for everyone to be able to 'come up for air' and consider the whole system of different skills and motivations that make up a given project.

For example, a product manager might as a developer:  when will "it" be done - and they might answer that it will be done in a week -- But the developer is focused on the current technical challenge - and the product manager may be thinking about the final release date.  Each individual in this small two-person 'system' is understandably focused on their specific view of the problem.  We create better solutions if we can gain a better understanding of the individual contributions, but also of the bigger 'system'.

<h3 style={{opacity: '.5', backgroundColor: '#640b8a', height: '35px' , padding:  '6px 10px', color: 'white'}}>Create constancy of purpose</h3>

Shingo defines "constancy of purpose" as clearly communicating the direction and purpose of the organization to all, and setting goals that are connected to the organization’s overall goals.  That's clearly the goal of this principle, but the nuance for software engineering management is the "constancy" part -- there are many forces in a software project, and it's easy to get into and endless cycle of firefights, or spend a lot of effort that seemed clearly important at the time but at the end of the year have not really produced the 'big' results that the organization needs.

In this changing world the ability to 'pivot' quickly is an asset, but it's equally important to have enough consistency of purpose to build the big things - even if they not perfect -- rather than spending an entire year on pivots and noodling that don't produce a discernible benefit to the organization.

If during an end-of-year goal setting we find ourselves saying that we did a ton of work but nothing that anyone is exited about now - then I think we need to seriously consider whether we have achieved the constancy of purpose the organization needs.


<h3 style={{opacity: '.5', backgroundColor: '#640b8a', height: '35px' , padding:  '6px 10px', color: 'white'}}>Create value for the customer</h3>

We all know what t feels like to deal with a great company with great customer service.   But for many organizations it's easy to get buried in the day-to-day grind, the lack of resources, the soccer game we have to get to by 7pm tonight.  It's easily become an organization full of well-meaning people that cannot seem to translate those good intentions into a consistent and cogent customer-facing presence.

I'm not sure whether there's one set of guidelines and practices that ensure great customer focus in any organization, but certainly at least part of the equation is just imbuing everyone consistently with the capacity, rewards, and the sense of ownership that adds up to greater customer value.
